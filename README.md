# ðŸ“¦ Folder Backup Script

This is a simple Bash script to back up any folder on your system into a `.zip` file with a timestamp in the filename. It ensures that the full absolute path is **not** included inside the zip file (to avoid nested directories like `home/user/...` when unzipped).

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- Takes user input for the folder path
- Creates a `.zip` backup with current date and time
- Only includes the target folder (no full path)
- Output file named like: `myfolder_backup_20250715_140030.zip`
- Automatically moves the zip file to the current working directory
